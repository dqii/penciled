## Implementation Notes

You might need to change the components to accept the props best suited for the website. For example, the Testimonials component needs to take in a role for this website, but Testimonials04, the preferred component, does not use that prop.

The first version of the website probably doesn't need to retrieve the images and save locally or save again; it could just retrieve the URLs and use them. On finalization we could replace the URLs.
